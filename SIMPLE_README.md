- `map<>` for key-value storage
- `string` for text processing
- Basic loops (`for`, `while`)
- Simple functions and classes
- File I/O for saving progress

### **No Complex DSA:**
- ❌ No Tries or advanced trees
- ❌ No complex graph algorithms  
- ❌ No advanced dynamic programming
- ❌ No complicated data structures
- ✅ Focus on fundamentals only

## 📖 Learning Approach

### **For Complete Beginners:**
```
Week 1: Arrays (Questions 1-5)
Week 2: Strings (Questions 6-8)  
Week 3: Search (Questions 9-10)
Week 4: Sorting (Questions 11-12)
Week 5: Review and Practice
```

### **Daily Practice:**
- **15 minutes per day** is enough to start
- **1 question per day** builds consistency
- **Use hints** when stuck, don't struggle too long
- **Understand the logic** before moving to next question

## 🎯 Question Examples

### Easy Level:
```cpp
// Find Maximum in Array - Simple loop
int findMax(vector<int> arr) {
    int max = arr[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < arr.size(); i++) {
        if (arr[i] > max) {
            max = arr[i];
        }
    }
    return max;
}
```

### Medium Level:
```cpp
// Binary Search - Divide and Conquer
int binarySearch(vector<int> arr, int target) {
    int left = 0, right = arr.size() - 1;
    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = (left + right) / 2;
        if (arr[mid] == target) return mid;
        else if (arr[mid] < target) left = mid + 1;
        else right = mid - 1;
    }
    return -1; // Not found
}
```
